        desc: <>It’s a matter of immense joy and pride for all AKGECians as our students have brought glory to the college by their spectacular performance in the 5th edition of Smart India Hackathon (SIH 2022), held Nationwide from 25th to 29th August 2022. Our seven (7) teams, five (5) in the software category and two (2) in the hardware category, have won the Hackathon titles, with each team been awarded with rupees One Lac prize money. It’s worth praising that highest number (14 teams) of teams were selected from our college among all public or private University/Institute in the whole Uttar Pradesh and in top 10 Institutes of India.
            <br />
            <br />
            Smart India Hackathon was started with its first edition in 2017 and is acclaimed as the World’s biggest open innovation model. SIH is an initiative by the Ministry of Education, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), Persistent Systems and Inter Institutional Inclusive Innovation Centre (i4C). It inculcates the culture of product innovation and problem-solving among students as well as promotes out-of-the-box thinking in young minds, especially engineering students from across India.
            <br />
            <br />
            A huge participation and win, in such a prestigious National initiative, is an indicator of extraordinary talent and inclination of our students towards innovation and creativity. I congratulate all the members of AKGU and appreciate our students for their amazing performance. I admire all the teams, including students and their faculty mentors, for their spirit and passion with which they have accomplished this feat. I am sure that AKGECians will continue this journey of triumph by their determined actions and commitment.
            <br />
            <br />
            Best Wishes to the students for success in all their future endeavours.</>
